The website is made with a few open source projects and I recommend looking over their documentation:
- Haml (html alturnative) http://haml.info/docs.html
- Bootstrap (for responsive design / assets) http://getbootstrap.com/
- Lightbox2 (for picture zoom/animations) http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/
- Sinatra http://www.sinatrarb.com/documentation.html
- Sinatra Flash (for flash messages after email is sent) https://github.com/SFEley/sinatra-flash
- Sinatra Simple Navigation https://github.com/codeplant/sinatra-simple-navigation
